                Nowadays, because of the pandemic, with the government making a trip abroad almost impossible to happend because of so many cases o f COVID-19, we have focused on one thing that almost all of us forget, there is so many people that like us wants to go abroad to visit our country, so why won`t we do it instead if we are already here and we never had a oportunity to give it a chance!
            </p> 
            <h2 class="sec-head" style="text-align: left;">Why Brasov?</h2> 
               <p class="proposition">
                   Brasov is an amazing city, is one of Europe`s few in-mountains created city that has developed so much over the years in tourism, being widely available for all people over the world. It has so many hotels, natural parks, restaurant of all kinds from late pubs to fine dinning experience, and even our usual home made breakfast that we all love.

                We love to discover new things and our team even grow up in Brasov since we were kids, and we have done and know everything that we thought would be posibble to be done here in our own city, and still we are so shocked to find out that there is so much more areas, tourism, agriculture, naturel parks, views that even we never seen after so many years descovering things in here. The reason why we believe we will give you the best or at least an unique experience here in Brasov is because to trip, to discover, the views and more, all those we love doing it for so long, and we create our business combining our passion with the need for people to finds uniques experiences as a tourist.
                We are focused on planning and organizing holidays, trips, experiences right here, in our Country, without the need of going abroad. We strongly believe that is so much that has to be seen yet that people of Romania never experience it or seen it in our own country.

                    I and my wife worked in tourism for more than 13 years in a local tourism company for schools, colleges, family trips etc... that organize mountain routes and mountain views experiences here in our little town, Sinaia witch is located in the city of Brasov
                    Recently we discuss with a college director, on how can students get discount to our trips in Brasov because their abroad trips have been canceled due to the pandemic... That`s when we decided to create this website, starting this company of promoting on taking holidays right here in our own country, where we promote all beautifull places that can be seen in Brasov.
